  <p>The word <q>bumph</q> is also English slang for paper&mdash;of any sort. 
    It is used on its own as in <q>there&apos;s a whole pile of bumph on my 
    desk</q>, and also with some other words, eg <q>loo bumph</q> is toilet 
    paper.</p>

    armed forces contraction for <q>Bum Fodder</q> during the Second World War 
    and was in regular use throughout the Commonwealth. <q>Bum fodder</q> was 
    itself a slang term for toilet paper.</p>
